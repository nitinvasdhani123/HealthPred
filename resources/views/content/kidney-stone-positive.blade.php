            <li><b>Consult with a Healthcare Professional:</b>
                <ul class="ul-list">
                    <li>Schedule an appointment with your doctor to discuss the prediction and undergo further testing. Your doctor can provide a more detailed diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan tailored to your needs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Increase Fluid Intake:</b>
                <ul class="ul-list">
                    <li>Drinking plenty of water helps prevent the formation of kidney stones by diluting substances in your urine. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses of water per day.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Adopt a Kidney-Friendly Diet:</b>

                    <li>Focus on a balanced diet that limits foods high in oxalates, such as spinach and beets, and reduce salt and animal protein intake. A nutritionist can help create a meal plan specific to your condition.</li>
